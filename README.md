# Instagram Redesign

Although the Instagram clone was deemed appropriate as the 2nd assignment given in the Bootstrap lesson on the [Beginner Level Frontend Web Development](https://app.patika.dev/paths/baslangic-seviye-frontend-web-development-patikasi) path on the Patika.dev course platform, I decided to redesign Instagram because I did not like the desktop view of Instagram.
