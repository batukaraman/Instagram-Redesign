# Instagram Redesign

Although the Instagram clone was deemed appropriate as the 2nd assignment given in the [Bootstrap lesson](https://app.patika.dev/courses/bootstrap) on the [Beginner Level Frontend Web Development Path](https://app.patika.dev/paths/baslangic-seviye-frontend-web-development-patikasi) on the Patika.dev course platform, I decided to redesign Instagram because I did not like the desktop view of Instagram.

I made this redesign inspired by Jean Delbrel's [Instagram Desktop Homepage Redesign](https://dribbble.com/shots/5469179-Instagram-Desktop-Homepage) project and with my own additions.
